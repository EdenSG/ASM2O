Course work.
Currently just **photography**, but more coming...

I use [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) in my setup; if you want to you can run `npm install` once you're in the directory to install the plugins I use.
Then `grunt` to minify the files, `grunt serve` to serve the project on `http://localhost:8000/`.
